    A simple bash prompt that can recognize VCS 


**note:** This will only tell you if you are standing inside a directory
which is under version control (subversion/git/mercurial/bazaar), nothing
more. For a fancy version use `__git_ps1` or something similar.

### Howto ###

Source the file `ps1.bash`, perhaps in some startup script:

    source /path/to/ps1.bash
